## Types of error in Java

- Syntax error : Wrong format - you did something wrong with the predefined rules of writing code
- Logical error : We planned one thing did another : like we planned to add 2 numbers but we multiplyed 2 numbers
- Runtime error : error which can come during run time like wrong input, someone misbehaving with url 

## How to deal with those 
- exception handling - to deal with runtime errors, so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained 

### runtime - try catch
try{

}catch(Type of expection){

}

- You can use multiple catches but they should be in order child first parent later

## throws vs throw


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## finally 
Chahe try challe ya na challe 
chahe except challe ya na challe 
finally tho pakka chalega 

finally can return but usually we dont return anything in finally block 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## try with 
try(){
    
}catch(){

}

here instead of using finally we use the object in the try() where the object made in closed for sure
