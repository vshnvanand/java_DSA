## What are genric and why generic 

- Main hai ki runtime error ko compile time mein convert krne ko help krti hai generic 

Naming convention
T = type (single element)
E = Element (used in collections)
K = Key (used in maps)
V = value (used in maps)
N = number 

- Simple language mein bola jaye tho it is a just a variable where you can only put values of datatype which you want of the object or the type you want to make 


- Generic class
- Generic Interface 
- Bounded type Parameters



- In these kind of scenario : class Boxx<T extends Number & Test>
The first will always be class and the second will be an interface 
like here Number is a class and Test is an interface 

- Bounded type only used keyword extend not implement weather it is a class or an interface
