## Variables 

Variables are containers to store data in memory. Each variable has a name, type and value. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. Java has 4 types of variables.

- Local Variables: Declared inside a method, constructor, or block. Accessible only within that block.
- Instance Variables: Declared inside a class but outside any method. Each object of the class has its own copy.
- Static Variables: Declared with the static keyword inside a class. Shared by all objects of the class.
- Final Variables: Declared with final keyword. Value cannot be changed once assigned.
